Choose-your-own-adventure webapp game based on Doraemon. Made with love in a 24h hackathon!


# Hackathon Project: Doraemon's Adventures

Hey! As a final project on our 14-week coding bootcamp, **we were challenged to develop a web app in 24 hours**. Themed as a "Childhood Throwback" hackathon, we got assigned Doraemon as a sub-theme.

And what better way to pay homage to both theme and sub-theme, than an old-school choose-your-own-adventure game in which the player helps Doraemon saving other anime characters and worlds?

This is a project in which we most of what we learned to use in 24 hours. **A frontend single page application for the user to play with, feeding off a backend database and rest API we also built.**

 - Is it perfect? Far from it.
 - Is it feature complete? We had to make some cuts.
 - Does it work? Yes...
 - **Are we proud of what we achieved?  Hell yeah. :)**

Dive in and check it yourself!


## How to launch

Open the backend project and run:
**`mvn tomcat7:deploy`**

Inject the database file (MySQL) if needed.

Go live with the frontend project.

Enjoy!
